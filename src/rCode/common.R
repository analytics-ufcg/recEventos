# File: partition_data.R
#   * Description: This file partition the events chronologically in 10 different
#                  data splits of train/test. Then a figure is generated to 
#                  support the partition quality analysis
#   * Inputs: the data_csv directory containing the events, rsvps and group csv 
#             files
#   * Outputs: the data_output directory with the data_partitions.csv file 
#              containing the events by city partitioned chronologically and; the 
#              data_partition_analysis-member_count.png figure with histograms
#              that support the analysis of the partitions by counting the  
#              members per data split (train and test).
