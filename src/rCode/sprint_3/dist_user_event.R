#   * Description: This file have two functions, k.nearest.events and recomendation.                     
#
#   * Inputs: Venues' table, events with location table, members' table
#
#   * Outputs: List of k events recomeded for users gived.The recomendation is made
#              according of distance between user's geo-location and event's geo-location
