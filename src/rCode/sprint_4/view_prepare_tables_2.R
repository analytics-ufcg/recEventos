# Visualization Constraint: The member_city should always be in venues_city, but
# the opposite is not right because there are 1956 venues with other venue_city
# names (the most with writing errors, just a few with no place) and they contain
# 10591 real events! Therefore, the venues and its events can't be discarded. 
#
# Obs.: We are not going to discard the venues explicitly but the processment of 
# spliting the venues by city will not add them to cities. They are going to be 
# used only when the member events or its recommendations were shown.
