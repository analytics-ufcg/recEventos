# File: partition_data.R
#   * Description: This file partition the events chronologically in 10 different
#                  data splits of train/test. Then a figure is generated to 
#                  support the partition quality analysis
#   * Inputs: the data_csv directory containing the events, rsvps and group csv 
#             files
#   * Outputs: the data_output directory with the data_partitions.csv file 
#              containing the events by city partitioned chronologically and; the 
#              data_partition_analysis-member_count.png figure with histograms
#              that support the analysis of the partitions by counting the  
#              members per data split (train and test).

# 1 - Exclude the state names and single letter cities
# 2 - Substitute digits and punctuations with an whitespace
# 3 - Substitute all sequential whitespaces with only one
# 4 - Delete the trailling and last whitespace
# 5 - Turn all words lowercase
# 6 - Turn all words Camel Case
